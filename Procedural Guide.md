## Guide to the "Guide"

## Glossary

- "**maltreatment**" is **虐待** in Chinese version of the Procedural Guide.  Also in the Guide, in communicating with the children and family members, may consider replacing the term “maltreatment” (“abuse” in Chinese version) with the term “harm” (傷害 ) taking into account of the impact(s) of the related incident on children.

- DeepSeek translated maltreatment to "**不當對待**" (more used in Taiwan) or "**苛待**"

- Cap 650 only uses **Abuse** and **虐待**

- FCPSU receives a report on child abuse (presumably substantiated)

  - collection of info from reporter (informant)

  - strategic planning in child protection

  - liaision with relevant parties, e.g. HKPF, MCCA/HKHA, appropriate adults/ relatives

  - provide Written Dated Notes to HKPF
